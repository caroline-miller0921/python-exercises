## Python Syntax

# python is case sensitive

# some words have specific uses and must be used with that in mind

# paired symbols - also know as delimiters - surround protions of code

# special characters may need to be escaped through a backslash

## Variables

# store data
# data is associated with a name
# can be accessed and used and also can be modified
# "=" setting a value of a variable 

my_number = 12
my_cohort = "O'Neil"

# can also update variables
# >>> a = 12
# >>> a
# 12

# a = a + 1
# now the variable a = 13

## Jupyter Notebook

# interactive computing platform
